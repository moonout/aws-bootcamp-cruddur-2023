# Week 5 — DynamoDB and Serverless Caching

### Overview

DynamoDB and the other serverless proprietary SQL and NoSQL databases are enormous topics to discuss. And, of course, this talk would be biased.

On the one hand, it allows doing great things with several lines of code — these things were available to Enterprise corporations only recently. The cons are that we are now trying to fix our issues with instruments designed for other, quite different problems.

In many cases, we have yet to learn how it works under the hood, so everything beyond the context of tutorials is hard to get.

Thanks to Alex DeBrie for his book. I bought it but didn't read it yet. It looks promising. Hope to find the answers there for the questions "why" and "when". Why is Single Table Design for good? Because now it seems like a spike for an unknown problem. 

### DDB security and performance

This topic is vast also. Unfortunately, we didn't talk about it much. After watching videos, DAX, VPC endpoints/gateways, and provisioning for reading and writing are still vague ideas. 

### Coding part

Wow, that was funny. I was trying to do some stuff one step before Andrew and it took x5 video time. I wish I had some experience with React to work on the frontend part. Hardcoded or non-implemented elements of the interface are annoying.

At this point, backend is working, the frontend is working, and service scripts allow to create, update and delete data both locally and on AWS.


### Final notes

I'm completely out of time, but I still participate. Andrew did a great job. Maybe someday this bootcamp will be payable, and I could buy it.
